I'm student at St. Petersburg (State) University. I am learning how to be :sparkles:_cool_:sparkles:. I'm joking, only mathematics:triangular_ruler:.

Also I like programming something in spare time. For example, I made [a game](https://github.com/m20-sch57/thetruehat) with my classmates in lockdown. And you can find some (La)TeX repos of my libraries, lecture notes etc. here.
